     quote: `It happened. President Trump has announced his plan to withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement. We’re now among the ranks of only two other countries who haven’t signed the agreement: Syria and Nicaragua (who didn’t sign the agreement because it wasn’t strict enough).  As evidenced by this decision, President Trump can do many things that you may or may not agree with. Case in point: 7 out of 10 American voters (and almost half of Trump voters) think the U.S. should participate in the Paris Climate Agreement.`,

     quote: `Certificate of Deposits (CDs) are some of the highest-yielding deposit accounts offered at most banks and credit unions. But, they come with a catch: your money is locked away for a certain period of time, and generally you can’t unlock it without paying an early withdrawal penalty.  It’s also no secret that interest rates are changing these days. That can also affect the returns you get from saving with CDs.Things only get more complex if you’re attempting to create what is called a CD Ladder, which can be used to take advantage of higher APYs while staggering investments so all your cash isn’t tied up for a very long time.`,

They give him food and water, clean his aerial pen, and check that he is healthy. One day, Rhesus 766 comes down with a fever. His visitors, concerned, bring him back to a building near the forest to run some tests. What they find is striking; a brand new, unknown virus is causing Rhesus 766’s symptoms.`,
